# Orders_prediction

This project focuses on predicting the number of orders a company may receive for a product using machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical sales data,  to help businesses optimize marketing strategies and inventory management.

The dataset includes key features such as store type, location type, region code, sales date, holiday status, discount availability, and past order volumes. Data preprocessing steps involved handling missing values, feature encoding, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key factors influencing order volume.

For model training, we used the LightGBM Regressor, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm, to predict order quantities based on these features. The dataset was split into training and test sets (80/20), and model evaluation was conducted to ensure accuracy and reliability.

Through this approach, businesses can forecast demand, allocate resources efficiently, and make data-driven marketing decisions.
